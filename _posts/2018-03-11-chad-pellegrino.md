title: Homemade San Pellegrino
teaser: I guess I'm putting recipes up here now
---

I've been procrastinating on brewing another batch of beer, which means I've got two empty kegs just sitting in my fridge. I've also been giving in and consuming more soft drinks with lunch - when I feel like being healthy I swap a Pepsi for a San Pellegrino.

Aside from that not actually being healthy at all, I just don't want to be in the habit of buying 6 packs of something that is ostensibly just fruit juice, water, and carbonation. So I'm gonna try to make some myself.

# The Recipe

- 24 oz		fresh clementine juice
- 5 oz		priming sugar (leftover from brewing)

Ream clementines until you have 24 oz of juice. This should be around 1.5 bags (4.5 lbs) of Cuties, so you'll still get to have some leftover as snacks.

Combine the juice, sugar, and about 1 gallon of water on the stove. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 20-30 minutes. This step is probably not very necessary.

Dump your fruit juice into a 5 gallon keg, straining through a fine nylon bag or what have you. Top off with 3 parts cold water. I just filled up the pot with tap water 3 times and dumped in it.

Hook up to CO2 to carbonate at 20 psi. I'm expecting it to be ready in a week.
