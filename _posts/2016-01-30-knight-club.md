title: KNIGHT CLUB

Naming stuff is really hard.

Every cool software person has their own domain.

I can't think of a good name.

And then I find "knight.club" on namecheap.

But it costs $4,560.47.

Damn.

That'd be so cool.

Now my whole blog is just talking about how much I want that domain name.

But there's also all the other things I need to spend money on.

Like food and housing.

Crap.

I really wanna buy this thing.
