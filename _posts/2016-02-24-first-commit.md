In the spirit of [gressing](https://techblog.workiva.com/tech-blog/gressing), it's
time to write something. 

I really wanted to set the tone with an interesting writeup of something cool I did
while designing the blog. But it really isn't easy to get things moving. And it's 
especially hard to motivate when the current post list is nothing but a stupid bit
of rambling I did on a whim.

So, let's start chipping away at the lack of content. Maybe next time it'll be 
interesting. Although, it could just as easily be a self-serving joke about how
Facebook is building a copycat of my personal website ಠ_ಠ
