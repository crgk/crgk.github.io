title: Today I Learned...
subtitle: And now we see if I can commit to a schedule.

[This guy](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) was probably not the first person to write down a new thing they learned each day, but he's the one I'm stealing this idea from.

If all goes well, I'll share all the little things I learn each day. Consider this a soft commitment to try to build a new habit.

My TILs will be available [here](/til/).
