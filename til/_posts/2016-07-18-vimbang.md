You execute external shell commands from within vim by prefixing with a `!`:

```
:! mvn test
```

This will pop you out into your shell until the command finishes.

Also, you can read the output of the command right into your current file:

```
:r! env
```
 
I like using it to move files around without leaving my editor, but I might start running code formatting, too.

> Update: It's also a great way to get sample command output into a blog post!
