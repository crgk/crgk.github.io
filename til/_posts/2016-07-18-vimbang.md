You execute external shell commands from within vim by prefixing with a `!`:

```
:! mvn test
```

This will pop you out into your shell until the command finishes.

Instead, you can read the output of the command right into your current file:
```
:r! env
```
 
I like using it to move files around without leaving my editor, but I might start running code formatting, too.
