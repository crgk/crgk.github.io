title: Granulated Caramel
---

If you put some white sugar on a sheet pan and throw it in an oven at
300&deg; for a few hours, stirring occasionally, you get granulated caramel.

It's like sugar in texture and can be used as a 1:1 replacement for regular
sugar, but it tastes caramel-y.

This is interesting because it doesn't just melt into liquid caramel.
