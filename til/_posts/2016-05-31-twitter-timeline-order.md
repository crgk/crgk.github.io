title: Twitter Timeline Order
---

Twitter has started showing popular tweets towards the top of timelines.
It's not always in reverse-chronological order.

This sucks, because I see old news and updates before the latest ones. The
Cubs are down 2, but the tweet telling me that got fewer likes than the one
about a strikeout from the first inning, so now I'm confused.

Luckily, this feature can be un-broken: go to your timeline settings and tell
Twitter to cut it out.
