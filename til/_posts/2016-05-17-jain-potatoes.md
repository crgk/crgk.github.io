title: Jain Potatoes

Jainism is an ancient religion from Indian. One of its three main principles is
_ahimsa_, or non-violence.

In practice, this extends to influence Jain diets, which are not only strictly vegetarian,
but can also exclude certain vegetables:

> Strict Jains, including monastics, do not eat root vegetables such as potatoes, onions and garlic because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a living being.

"isn't there a religion that doesn't eat potatoes?"
