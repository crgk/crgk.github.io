title: Chromatic Aberration
---

While watching an hour long video of tips on photorealistic CGI rendering, I learned the
phrase "Chromatic Aberration" and then wondered what the hell I'm doing with my life.

Chromatic Aberration sounds cool as heck, and is an effect in photography where where you see
colors like reds, blues, or purples showing up around the edges of objects or borders between
light and dark areas. Like this "purple fringing" on the hair of a horsie:

This effect has something to do with the lens of the camera being not very good, I guess.

So, not actually that cool, but these TILs are more of an exercise in smart-sounding titles
than anything else.
