title: Mac Screenshots

I always forget these:

> * Command-Shift-3: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it as a file on the desktop
> * Command-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of an area and save it as a file on the desktop
> * Command-Shift-4, then space, then click a window: Take a screenshot of a window and save it as a file on the desktop
> * Command-Control-Shift-3: Take a screenshot of the screen, and save it to the clipboard
> * Command-Control-Shift-4, then select an area: Take a screenshot of an area and save it to the clipboard
> * Command-Control-Shift-4, then space, then click a window: Take a screenshot of a window and save it to the clipboard

You can also change where your screenshots are saved:

`defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots/`
