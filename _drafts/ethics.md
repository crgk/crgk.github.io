title: Ethical Software Engineering

* vw emissions
* apple v fbi
* no single engineer fully responsible for any piece of enterprise software

* ethics, responsibility must be systemic
* individuals need to internalize these ethics

* knowledge and expertise give power to create things other people don't understand
* do not deceive

* most responsible thing is to open source your projects
* consider total value to society
* closed software is inherently worth less than open
* intellectual property bleeds more into legal ethics, imo
