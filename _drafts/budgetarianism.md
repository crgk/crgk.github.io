title: Budgetarianism
---

This is a post about my diet. It is a diet in the sense that it is a set of constraints that I apply to my meal choices. It is not a weight-loss strategy or a moral statement. My diet is mostly a method for me to be more mindful of the foods I choose to eat. This post exists mostly as an exercise for myself to define what I've been doing as a diet.

- take control over part of your life
- do it in a way that's easy to succeed

- Eat within your rules
- Allow yourself to choose to cheat
- Iterate towards your ideal

1. Have something you want to change about how you eat
1. Describe that goal in measurable terms
1. Allow yourself a budget of exceptions (or cheats)
1. Track how well you do and keep getting better

- Biggest pro: regular reflection (and forecasting of) on what I eat
- Side bonus: doesn't have to come up in conversation, doesn't limit social activity

- Stop eating meat
  - where seafood doesn't count as meat
  - and animal byproducts are allowed

- Anecodtal benefits of eating less meat:
  - less food waste / more fresh food
  - more exploration
  - feel better!

What hasn't happened:
- I have not significantly lost weight
