title: Where Do I Grow From Here?
---

Heretofore, my job has been a pretty constant series of growth opportunities. 
(I'm using _opportunity_ in the "you either adjust to this new reality or feel 
like a failure" sense.)

It's been awesome. I love learning new things, and nothing scratches my 
"accomplishment itch" quite like a little incremental progress. 

Seriously, give me an idle web game with no plot, art, humor, or discernible
point, and I'll still click whatever it  is that fills up progress bars and
unlocks achievements. Take [AdVenture Capitalist](_adcap), for example. I tapped
away mindless hours on that game, watching countless ads for other shitty mobile
games, and I didn't complain once. Right up until  there wasn't anything left to
unlock on Mars.

> Why do anything if there isn't a next step?

That also echoes what I experience in my day-to-day job. Each PR makes as small 
of a change as possible. Projects are broken into as many steps as feasible.
Deadlines are avoided. There's always something on the backlog.

Just one foot in front of the other.

But what happens when your next step isn't clear?


# Back to the start

Starting out as a Software Engineer out of college, I found quickly that my main strength was being passable-to-competent at
most of the required skills.

Even though I was now getting paid to write code, I felt far from a pro. My new 
team and dev manager were phenomenal resources helping me grow as a developer. 
Every day, it felt like I turned on the faucet to a stream of new concepts, 
principles, best practices, and core tenets of building software.

In my first year or so, I learned:

* basic python syntax
* idiomatic python
* well-tested python
* efficient python
* what is jquery really
* how to use jquery
* how to avoid using jquery
* HTTP but for real this time
* realities of serving a webapp
* sessions are scary as shit
* things Django makes easy
* things Django makes awful
* how to profile webapp performance
* what "deferring a task" means
* why it was crazy to not use agile
* how agile isn't just having standups
* ...and plenty more

Looking back after that first iteration of me as a Software Engineer, it's hard 
to believe I made it through the interview. I had nothing but room for growth.
