title: Where Do I Grow From Here?
---

Heretofore, my job has been a pretty constant series of growth opportunities.
It's been awesome. I love learning new things, and nothing scratches my
"accomplishment itch" quite like a little incremental progress. I don't want to
guess at how many hours I've spent playing games that boil down to incremental progress
just for the sake of finding new progress bars to fill.

That also echoes what I experience in my day-to-day job. Each PR makes as small
of a change as possible. Projects are broken into as many steps as feasible.
Deadlines are avoided. There's always something on the backlog.

Just one foot in front of the other.

But what happens when your next step isn't clear?
