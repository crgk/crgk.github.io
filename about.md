I'm Chad Knight. This is my place to write things. It's out here for you to read
because otherwise what's the point.

Sometimes I'll write code. Just messing around, stretching the ol' web muscles. I'm supposed to be a software engineer, so it feels like I should stay on top of how a static website is built.

Sometimes I'll write blog posts. For the amount of time I spend communicating via text, you'd think I'd be quite a bit better at it. So it's time to start getting ideas into writing more often.

I don't anticipate this site becoming a fount of brilliance and insight. Hopefully, at some point, there will be more for me to write about than myself. And maybe there will be more people reading, too.

Let's see what this becomes.
