You guys... what if I owned [knight.club](knight.club)? Just think about that with me for a bit.

I could host this blog on [knight.club/blog](knight.club/blog). And it'd be like if a night club was a blog.

When I buy something at Banana Republic and they ask me for my email instead of awkwardly 
saying "chad r wait do I have to tell you?" I'd get this huge grin, stand up a little straighter,
wait until she looks up from the terminal and makes eye contact with me, then pretty much yell 
"CHAD AT KNIGHT CLUB. CHAD LIKE THE COUNTRY, KNIGHT LIKE MY NAME, CLUB LIKE NO GIRLS ALLOWED."
 
People would be searching for hot night clubs in their area and then they'd end up on my site.
I could sell ads and make fat stacks of cashtown money from their mistake. But would it really
be a mistake anymore? They'd love it in the [knight.club](knight.club). Bet they'd decide to stay home and just
visit my site.

There more we talk about it, the more I need it to happen. This is my calling. I am on this earth to
create [knight.club](knight.club). It's all so clear now.

Come with me on this journey.
