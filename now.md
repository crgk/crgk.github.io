I currently live with my fianceé and cat in Chicago. I'm becoming a hobbyist baker and have a growing vinyl collection. It's terribly yuppie millennial.

By day, I am a mild-mannered software engineer at Workiva. I work from home often.

My fiancée and I are building a website for our wedding. I'm uncomfortable having a deadline for this project.
