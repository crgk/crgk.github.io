I currently live with my fianceé and cat in Chicago. I try to share my time between enjoying the city and lounging on my couch.

My free time fills up with food, drink, and friends. I tell myself that I read books, write a blog, and listen to the radio, but actually it's just mostly Netflix and Reddit. 

Workiva pays me to be a software engineer. I work from home mostly.

Wedding plans are picking up - the big day is next May.
