I currently live with my fianceé and cat in Chicago.

I'm helping Workiva build software to make it easier for folks to do work.

It's gotten to the point where I have to put board games (and now DnD) on my list of hobbies. I own many different sized dice. I successfully brewed a batch of beer, which I'm calling "One Man Block Party". It was profoundly acceptable.
